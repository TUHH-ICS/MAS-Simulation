classdef(Abstract) BaseAgent < handle & matlab.mixin.Heterogeneous
    %BASEAGENT Defines the basic properties of an agent in the simulation
    %framework.
    %   All specific agent classes must inherit from this abstract class,
    %   as it defines the basis properties, that are required during
    %   simulation.
    
    properties(GetAccess = public, SetAccess = immutable)
        id         % Number that uniquely identifies the agent in the network
        dT         % Time between to calls to the step function
    end
    
    properties(GetAccess = private, SetAccess = private)
        dataToSend % Saves the data the agent wants to transmitt until the networks fetches it
        messages   % Buffer for received messages of this agent
    end

    properties(Dependent, GetAccess = public, SetAccess = immutable)
        order      % Dynamic order, dimension of the state space of the agent
    end
    
    properties(Abstract, Dependent, GetAccess = public, SetAccess = private)
        % These dependent properties are only there for convenience. Because
        % the position and velocity can be encoded in arbitrary states, this is
        % used to easy working with the agents without increasing the storage
        % cost.
        position % Current position of the agent
        velocity % Current velocity of the agent
        
        % The state is also saved as a dependent property. In this way, the
        % agent implementation can choose how to implement the dynamics.
        % Either, the predefined dynamics objects can be used, which
        % contain a state themselves, or it can choose to declare a local
        % variable and manually implement the dynamics
        state    % Dynamic state of the agent
    end
    
    methods
        function obj = BaseAgent(id, dT)
            %BASEAGENT Construct an instance of this class
            %   network is a reference to the network object.
            %   dT is the time between two simulation steps

        function msgs = receive(obj, ~, msgs)
            %RECEIVE Function that agent implementation can call to receive
            %messages from other agents in the network.
            %   This default implementation is meant to be used if the
            %   agent only processes messages in its own step function. If
            %   processing between steps is required, you must override
            %   this function.

        %STEP Function that gets called at each simulation step
        %   All agent implementations should override this method to

            %   The data is not send immediately, but stored until the
            %   network requests it.

            %GETMESSAGE Function that returns the message that this agent
            %wants to send.

            %GETDEFAULTSCALARELEMENT Provides a default element for Matlab
