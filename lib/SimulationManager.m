classdef(Sealed) SimulationManager < handle
    %SIMULATIONMANAGER Class to manage the simulation of multi-rate
    %discrete-time multi-agent systems.
    %   This class makes it easier to simulate networks of agents with
    %   heterogeneous sample times among the agents and the network. The
    %   sample times do not need to be integer multiples.

        nextAgentCall   % Contains the time when each agent should be called next
        nextNetworkCall % Contains the time when the network should be called next

        function k = estimateSteps(obj, T)
            %ESTIMATESTEPS Estimates the number of calls to the step
            %function that are required to reach the time T.
            %   The estimation of the number of calls to step() is required
            %   for preallocating the required buffer arrays. This
            %   function works by performing a dry run of the simulation,
            %   i. e. it stops the time but does not execute the agent
            %   functions.
