classdef MarkovNetwork < MatlabNetwork
    %MARKOVNETWORK Network implementation that models paket loss using a
    %two-state Markov chain.
    %   The network implements a 2-state Markov chain for each channel. One
    %   state for a failed channel, one for a good channel. At each
    %   sampling instance, the chain is advanced in time according to the
    %   given transition probabilities p_fail and p_recover.
    
    properties(GetAccess = public, SetAccess = immutable)
        range     % Range of the communication
        p_fail    % Probability that a good channels fails
        p_recover % Probability that a failed channel recovers
        symmetric % If true, only symmetric packet loss is considered, i.e.
                  % if one direction fails, the other does as well.
    end
    
    properties(GetAccess = public, SetAccess = private)
        state     % State of the Markov chain. This is a boolean variable,
                  % not a probability distribution, as we are considering
                  % only a single realization of the Markov chain here.
