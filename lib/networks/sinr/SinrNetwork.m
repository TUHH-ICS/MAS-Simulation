classdef SinrNetwork < BaseNetwork
    %SINRNETWORK Class that wraps the C++ networking library from the
    %University of Koblenz for use in this simulation library.
    %   The C++ networking library gets embedded in Matlab as a compiled
    %   MEX function. Different aspects of the library get called using a
    %   string command interface.
    %
    %   It is currently not possible to create multiple instances of the
    %   SinrNetwork class as the MEX function interface has a global
    %   internal state. Multiple instances of the network would corrupt
    %   this state.
