classdef BernoulliNetwork < MatlabNetwork
    %BERNOULLINETWORK Network implementation that models paket loss using a
    %simple Bernoulli distribution.
    %   The network has a fixed and uniform transmission probability p,
    %   that controls with which probability a message is receive if the
    %   recipient is in the transmission range.
    
    properties(GetAccess = public, SetAccess = immutable)
        range     % Range of the communication
        p         % Probability of a successful transmission
        symmetric % If true, only symmetric packet loss is considered, i.e.
                  % if one direction fails, the other does as well.
